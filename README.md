# Commit-Show

## Description

This is an app created with React for the frontend and Node js for the backend. It was made for a test. It uses Github's API to display a list of commits of this project.

## Disclaimer

This app was created entirely by me, feel free to use it however you want, but if you find it useful and will use it in production or present it inside your own project, please ask for my permission first. 

## Requisites

To follow the instructions to start the app you will need [node, npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your system.

## Instructions

1) Open a terminal and clone the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/RamProg/Commit-Show.git
```

This will create a folder and download the project inside.

2) Install needed packages.

Open another terminal inside the folder you just created and run:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the required modules for the project. 

3. Start the server.

```
npm start
```

This will start the backend. The terminal should display a message like:

"Server listening on 3001"

4. Start the app.

You need to open a new console and run:

```
cd cliente
npm start
```

5. Open the app.

A browser window should open after a few seconds. If it doesn't, just go to your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc) and open this URL:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```
